# Projectiles 

Projectiles are put into their own category so that they can be updated and drawn with a list. It is also 
mush easier to add, remove, and manage projectiles this way. 

Depsite being called as "projectile", it's not just for ranged attacks. Melee attack also releases
projectile, but it's just slower(keep with attacker) and shorter. 

It is set this way to distinguish attack from collision.

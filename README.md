This is an open source 2D top down game of a young girl happily explores a whimsical dungeon 
filled with rainbow, flowers, and unicorn.

By the end it should have all codes, images (include PSDs), and music available.

Note that this project has a strong personal flavour, I do try to keep the naming, comments, and implementation 
consistent, but it is not strictly bound to any design pattern or strategy. Like sometimes the word "level" and 
"room" is used as if they are same, "mouse" and "cursor" can also be interchangeable in the naming.

Currently still work in progress.

Dev logs

* Items count CD on its own and still counts when in the bag, it seems possible to quickly 
switch item in and out of slots and thus drastically increase the ability of the character.
I don't really want to change that, it feels fun.

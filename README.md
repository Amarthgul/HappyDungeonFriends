This is an open source 2D top down game of a young girl happily explores a whimsical dungeon 
filled with rainbow, flowers, and unicorn.

By the end it should have all codes, images (include PSDs), and music available.

Note that this project has a strong personal flavour, I do try to keep the naming, comments, and implementation 
consistent, but it is not strictly bound to any design pattern or strategy. Like sometimes the word "level" and 
"room" is used as if they are same, "mouse" and "cursor" can also be interchangeable in the naming.

Currently still work in progress. 

まだまだ...

This is an open source 2D top down game of a young girl happily explores a whimsical dungeon 
filled with rainbow, flowers, and unicorn.

By the end it should have all codes, images (include PSDs), and music available.

Note that this project has a strong personal flavour, I do try to keep the naming, comments, and implementation 
consistent, but it is not strictly bound to any design pattern or strategy.

Currently still work in progress. 

まだまだ...
